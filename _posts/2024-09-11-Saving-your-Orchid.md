It can be disheartening if an orchid's flowers begin to fall off, but there is a simple way to get the plant to rebloom again using a natural cooking ingredient you would have otherwise poured down the drain.

Orchids are known for their stunning blooms which last a long time, and you can get them to flower a second time in the year if you feed them the right fertiliser.
