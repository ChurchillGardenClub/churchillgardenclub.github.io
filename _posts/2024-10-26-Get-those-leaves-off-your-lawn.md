## Composting Leaves for Garden Mulch

Get those leaves off your lawn and recycle them onto your flower and vegetable beds for a free nutrient boost.

Beautiful as they are, colorful autumn leaves can be a real clean up process. 

Instead of bagging them up or letting them blow away, you can turn them into a valuable resource for your garden. 

Leaf mulch and grass clippings are nutritional organic materials that can be recycled to benefit your plants, combat soil erosion, correct clay soil or adjust the pH caused by pine needles.
