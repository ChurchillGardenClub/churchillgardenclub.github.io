## Provide Year-Round Food And Shelter For Goldfinches By Adding These Trees

Goldfinches are bright, beautiful birds that can be found over a lot of North America. If you want to see more of them in your yard, try planting these trees.

Goldfinches (Spinus spp.) are stunningly beautiful birds, and with a range that covers most of the United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico, there's a good chance they live in your neighborhood.

Planting conifer trees is a great way to provide these gorgeous birds with not only shelter and protection during the winter but also food and even materials to build nests with.
