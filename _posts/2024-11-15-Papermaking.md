## Redeeming invasive plants through paper making, repurposing and art.

Albert Pantone, a fiber artist, uses the most infuriating and invasive plant in the Northeast, Japanese knotweed.

He shows his students how to identify the plant, harvest, cook down, and beat the fibers to a pulp. Finally, students make paper from the processed knotweed pulp.

Churchill Garden Club recently hosted Albert in our Papermaking workshop
